## Features
- Change the orientation of the app on any screen.
- Change between light/dark modes.
- Supports the 'used email' specified in the challenge.
- Handles the 400 error.
- Stores registered email in User Defaults

## For Next Time
- I'd like to have an animated gif of the broccoli perhaps doing a floss dance move for the celebration screen.
- Make a more reactive user input validation possibly using combine.
